# Beta Testing

## Commoner's Advice
- UI should be smaller,
- Gameplay submenu in options is confusing,
- Game would really benefit from audio,
- Minos "too rectangular",
- Did like seeing the pieces on the side.

## Expert's Advice
- It's a little wacky that the long piece disappears for a bit if you rotate it before it gets too low,
- Does like that they could rebind the controls,
- Swap is neat, keeps you on edge if you're not paying close attention to when the next swap is,
- Resolution scaling should be added, as it looks weird when going full screen on their monitor,
- They'd add more back buttons and things like that the game over screen. For example, using escape to go back to the menu and instantly end the game.
