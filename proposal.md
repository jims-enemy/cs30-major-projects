# Major Project Proposal

## Description
I plan to finish and add to my version of Tetris that I made for project 2.

## Needs to Have List
- All work previously done,
- The ability to hold pieces,
- Line clearing,
- UI that, as a minimum, show the held piece, next pieces, score, and level.
- Better documented and cleaner code, especially in the movePiece() function,
- A main menu, with the minimum following categories:
    - an option menu (including rebindable keys, volume slider, etc.),
    - a help menu,
    - and a button to begin the game,
- The Korobeiniki song.

## Nice to Have List
- Ghost piece (where the piece will end up if a hard drop is performed),
- Way better graphics,
- Animations,
- Other game modes (including, multiplayer, vs. AI, and sending garbage to other game boards upon line clearage, for example).
