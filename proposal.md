# Major Project Proposal

## Description
I plan to finish and add to my version of Tetris that I made for project 2.

## Needs to Have List
- All work previously done,
- The ability to hold pieces,
- Line clearing,
- Sending garbage to other game boards upon line clearage,
- UI that, as a minimum, show the held and next pieces,
- Better documented and cleaner code, especially in the movePiece() function.

## Nice to Have List
- Way better graphics,
- Animations,
- Ghost piece (where the piece will end up if a hard drop is performed),
- The Korobeiniki song,
- Other game modes (including a multiplayer and a vs. AI as examples),
- An option menu (including rebindable keys, volume slider, etc.),
- Score and level display.
